# AMath
## An Advanced Math Module for Python

**Warning**: Wolfram Alpha integration, few functions require internet connectivity.

### Working Features:
- Basic mathematical functions
  - Sqrt, fac, sin, mean, log
- Mathematical constants ~~and formulas~~
  - e, pi, golden ratio, infinity, Pythagorean theorem
- Advanced mathematical functions
  - Factor, prime numbers, permutations, GCD/LCM, Sum, regression
- Fraction, Infinity and DateTime support
- List functions
  - Multiple sorting methods, searching, replacement
- Basic statistical functions
  - Means, mode, median, regression
- String manipulation
  - Word identification
- Python type manipulation and testing

### Current Issues:
- C integration for some mathematical functions are finicky
- Formulas producing incorrect answers randomly
  - Function class has issues with variable order causing a chance of incorrect answers
- Arbitrary Precision Numbers have some initialization issues

### Future Features:
- Symbolic operations and equation manipulation
- Machine and Unlimited Precision numbers for increased Precision
- Movement of basic functions over to C
